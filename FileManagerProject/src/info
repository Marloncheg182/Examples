Hello my Friend
This is my first tutorial file manager. And you can use it for simple operations with folders and files inside those folders.
You should know the general conditions of using, if you want to avoid bad actions.
So:

First of all, you need to open your folder, for this action: type your full path name to folder and push the Enter button.
After this operation you will receive a list of folders and files, if they are exist.
Example:    C:\Program Files\

Second operation will be used, if you want to copy file or folder. You need to input your path "from" , and path "to" completely . Then push Enter button.
After this operation, your variable (file/dir) will be copied to "to" path.
Example:    C:\Program Files\my-copy-example.txt
            D:\my-copy-example.txt

Third operation will be used, if you want to move file or folder. You should input full path of you file/folder , and full path of folder, which will be used like a new "home" , for your element. Then push Enter button.
After this operation, your variable will be moved to chosen directory.
Example:    C:\Program Files\my-move-example.txt
            D:\my-move-example.txt

Fourth operation will be used, if you wanna delete file or folder from your path. Ypu should input a full path to file/folder, and push the Enter button.
After this operation, your variables will be erased forever.
Example:    D:\my-move-example.txt



Thank`s for testing:
