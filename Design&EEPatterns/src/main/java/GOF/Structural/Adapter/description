While implementing Adapter pattern, there are two approaches – class adapter and object adapter, however both these approaches produce same result.

Class Adapter – This form uses java inheritance and extends the source interface, in our case Socket class.
Object Adapter – This form uses Java Composition and adapter contains the source object.
