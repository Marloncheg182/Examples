Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently

The number of Objects to be created by application should be huge.
The object creation is heavy on memory and it can be time consuming too.
The object properties can be divided into intrinsic and extrinsic properties,
extrinsic properties of an Object should be defined by the client program.
