Interpreter pattern can be used when we can create a syntax tree for the grammar we have.
Interpreter pattern requires a lot of error checking and a lot of expressions and code to
evaluate them, it gets complicated when the grammar becomes more complicated and hence hard to
maintain and provide efficiency.java.util.Pattern and subclasses of java.text.Format are some
of the examples of interpreter pattern used in JDK.
