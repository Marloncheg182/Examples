Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object
without exposing its underlying representation.
Iterator pattern is useful when you want to provide a standard way to iterate
over a collection and hide the implementation logic from client program.
The logic for iteration is embedded in the collection itself and it helps client
program to iterate over them easily.
