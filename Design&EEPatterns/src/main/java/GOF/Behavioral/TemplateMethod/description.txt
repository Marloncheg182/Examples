Template method should consists of certain steps whose order is fixed and for some of the methods,
implementation differs from base class to subclass. Template method should be final.
Most of the times, subclasses calls methods from super class but in template pattern,
superclass template method calls methods from subclasses, this is known as
Hollywood Principle – “don’t call us, we’ll call you.”.
Methods in base class with default implementation are referred as Hooks
and they are intended to be overridden by subclasses, if you want some of the methods to be not overridden,
you can make them final, for example in our case we can make buildFoundation() method final because
if we don’t want subclasses to override it.
