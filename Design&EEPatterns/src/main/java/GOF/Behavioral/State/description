The benefits of using State pattern to implement polymorphic behavior is clearly visible,
the chances of error are less and its very easy to add more states for additional behavior
making it more robust, easily maintainable and flexible. Also State pattern helped in
avoiding if-else or switch-case conditional logic in this scenario.
